# chefStats <a href="https://hta-pharma.github.io/chefStats/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" alt="chefStats website" /></a>

A library of statistical methods for chef-style AMNOG analyses

# Aim

The {chefStats} package aims to provide a library of fast, validated methods for use in AMNOG analysis created by the chef package.

As the functions found in chefStats are designed to be used with [chef](https://hta-pharma.github.io/chef) in the context of the [ramnog](https://hta-pharma.github.io/ramnog) framework, it may be unwieldy to use these functions independently. 


# Installation

The package is available to install from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("hta-pharma/chefStats")
```


# How to contribute

For information on how to contribute, please refer to [ramnog contributing documentation](https://hta-pharma.github.io/ramnog/articles/dev_contribute).

# More information

These site focuses on the functions of chefStats. For more context on how these functions should be utilized to produce an AMNOG-like analysis, please see the [ramnog](https://hta-pharma.github.io/ramnog) documentation.
