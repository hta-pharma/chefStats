# Library of statistical methods for chef-style AMNOG analyses

The chefStats package aims to provide a library of fast, validated
methods for use in AMNOG analysis created by the chef package.h

As the functions found in chefStats are designed to be used with chef,
it may be unwieldy to use these functions independently.
