)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data.table. The analysis data set.}

\item{event_index}{vector of integers that index the rows in \code{dat} that match
the definition of an 'event'. Matching is done via the \code{INDEX_} column in
\code{dat}.}

\item{cell_index}{A vector of integers referencing the rows of \code{dat} (as
specified by the \code{INDEX_} column in \code{dat}) that match the population to be
analyzed. See the "Endpoint Events" vignette in {ramnog}
for more information.}

\item{treatment_var}{character. The name of the treatment variable in \code{dat}.}

\item{treatment_refval}{character. The reference value of the treatment variable in \code{dat}.}

\item{subjectid_var}{character. Name of the subject identifier variable in \code{dat} (default is "USUBJID").}

A matrix

\description{
Makes a two-by-two contingency table which takes the visual form:\tabular{lcc}{
    \tab Outcome \tab observed \cr
    \tab Yes \tab No \cr
   Treatment \tab A \tab B \cr
   Comparator \tab C \tab D \cr
}


Where A, B, C, and D are the distinct number of subjects satisfying the
criteria of each 2x2 cell.

Only observations that have a Treatment value recorded are returned.
