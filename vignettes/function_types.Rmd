## Statistical method types in chef and chefStats

The chef framework categorizes statistical functions into three main categories depending on how they operate over stratification levels and treatment levels. Operations can either be done once per stratification level or treatment level, or they can operate across levels. 

Figure 1 below shows a typical table from a safety analysis and color codes each result based on the function type that creates it:

```{r statDesc, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Figure 1"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/StatisticsDescription.png")
```

<br>
Table 1 below provides a description of each of the three function types, color coded to the outputs they produce in table 1 above:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt <-
  data.table::data.table(
    Name = c(
      cell_spec("stat_by_strata_and_trt", "html", color = "red"),
      cell_spec("stat_by_strata_across_trt", "html", color = "green"),
      cell_spec("stat_across_strata_across_trt", "html", color = "blue")
    ),
    Description = c(
      "For each strata type (e.g. SEX, AGEGR, etc): one output per unique combination of strata level and treatment level",
      "For each strata type (e.g. SEX, AGEGR, etc): one output per strata level, across treatment levels",
      "One output per strata type (e.g. SEX, AGEGR, etc), across treatment levels"
    ),
    
    `Example function` = c(  "`n_subj()` - Counts number of subjects in each stratification level and treatment level",
      "`RR()` - Calculates the relative risk for the outcome/event within a stratification level",
      "`p_val_interaction()` - Test of interaction effect for stratification level"
    ),
    `Example application` = c(
      "What is the total number of Females in TreatmentA",
      "What is the relative risk of having the outcome for females in Treatment A as compared to females in Treatment B",
      "Is the risk of having the outcome different across the strata of SEX"
    )
  )
dt |>
  kable(format = "html",escape = FALSE,
        table.attr = "class='table table-bordered'",
        caption = "Table 1") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "responsive")) |>
   row_spec(0, background = "#2C3E50", color="white") |> 
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "10em",)

```


 
The function type also determines when the function is applied. In our example from figure 1, a <code style="color: red;">stat_by_strata_by_trt</code> function will be called once for each combination of stratification level and treatment level, as well as once for TOTALS for each treatment level: 

  1. SEX == "MALE" & TRT == "TreatmentA"
  2. SEX == "FEMALE" & TRT == "TreatmentA"
  3. SEX == "MALE" & TRT == "TreatmentB"
  3. SEX == "FEMALE" & TRT == "TreatmentB"
  3. AGE == "<65" & TRT == "TreatmentA" 
  3. AGE == ">=65" & TRT == "TreatmentA"
  3. AGE == "<65" & TRT == "TreatmentB"
  3. AGE == ">=65" & TRT == "TreatmentB"
  3. TOTAL_ == "total" & TRT == "TreatmentA"
  3. TOTAL_ == "total" & TRT == "TreatmentB"

Whereas a `stat_across_strata_across_trt` will only be called once per stratification "group", i.e.:
  
  1. strata_var == "SEX"
  1. strata_var == "AGE"
